# Pot-Shaped-Graph-Analyzer
Third year miniProject aimed to develop a system that utilises graph-based techniques to analyse images, focusing on similarity detection, classification, and path finding

Problem Statement
South Africa has two common things all people can relate too first one being Loadshedding, and second being Potholes in our roads.
We know the pain of hitting a pothole when driving your car, you can even feel the pain of the driver if youâ€™re traveling on a uber/public transport , it can damage vehicles, delay trips and cause serious accidents.
Traditional pothole detection methods manual inspections and visual surveys are slow, labour-intensive, and often ineffective, especially in rural or remote areas.

Core Problem
There are no efficiient, scalable tools to acccess road conditions in rural areas and help both drivers and authorities tackle pothole related issues.

Problem Solution
I'm going to develop an image analysis-based system that detects and evaluates potholes by analysing road surface images using two key techniques:
Graph-Based Pathfinding: Road images are converted into graph representations, allowing the system to trace paths and identify disruptions indicative of cracks or potholes.
Image Similarity Detection: The system compares new road images with known samples of damaged surfaces to detect and flag similarities consistent with potholes.
